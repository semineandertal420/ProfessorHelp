Error: Im trying to implement the "roll" action, I've menage to make a cooldown, but 
there are two problems. First one is when the player rolls the maxspeed get set by the
roll force. And the second is, the player its suposed to go through the enemies, so I've
created a boolean to check if the player has rolled. But when you roll it only goes back
to false when the player press any key. Or if he is already pressing a move direction it
keeps on true.
